Application is made for probability estimation of recurence of breast cancer based on user's data.

Application has poll for user to fill. Based on this data, application uses Random Forest with Naive Bayes classifiers to estimate
probability of breast cancer recurence.
Application also shows quality of prediction, which is accuracy of classification, so user can see how reliable is the result.

As a result I get machine learning model, which can be used to estimate the future condition of patient health.

Few pictures of application:
